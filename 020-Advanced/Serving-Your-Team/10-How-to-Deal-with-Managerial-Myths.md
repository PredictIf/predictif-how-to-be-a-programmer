# How to Deal with Managerial Myths

The term *myth* often suggests a fabrication, yet its significance extends beyond mere fiction to embody tales with profound religious meanings that elucidate the cosmos and our place within it. Managers, having transitioned away from their programming roots, may hold certain myths to be true. Directly challenging these beliefs is as futile as attempting to sway a deeply religious individual from their faith. Hence, it's crucial to acknowledge these managerial myths:

- The belief that more documentation invariably enhances a project. (They desire documentation but prefer you not to dedicate much time to it.)
- The assumption that all programmers are interchangeable. (In reality, the skill range among programmers is vast.)
- The notion that adding more resources to a delayed project will expedite completion. (Often, the increased communication overhead outweighs any potential benefits.)
- The idea that software development timelines can be predicted accurately. (Such precision in estimates is fundamentally unattainable.)
- The view that a programmer's output can be quantified through simplistic metrics, such as lines of code. (Given that efficiency often means writing less code, this metric is flawed.)

Should the chance arise, you might attempt to gently correct these misconceptions, but don't be disheartened if you don't make headway, nor risk your standing by aggressively disputing these myths. Each myth perpetuates the illusion of managerial control over the unpredictable nature of software development. In truth, effective managers are those who enable their teams, whereas ineffective ones hinder progress.
