# How to Communicate Well

To communicate well, you have to recognize how hard it is. It is a skill unto itself. It is made harder by the fact that the persons with whom you have to communicate are flawed. They may not work hard at understanding you. They may speak poorly and write poorly. They may be often overworked or bored, and, at a minimum, somewhat focused on their own work rather than the larger issues you may be addressing.

The programmer should bring order out of chaos. Entrepreneurs who are not programmers need programmers to provide leadership in some ways. Programmers are the part of the bridge between ideas and reality that rests on reality.

I haven't mastered communicating well, but what I'm currently trying is what I think of as a four-pronged approach: After I have my ideas in order, and am fully prepared, I try to speak verbally, hand people a OneNote notebook, show them a demo, and then patiently repeat this process. I think a lot of times we are not patient enough in this kind of difficult communication. You should not be disheartened if your ideas are not immediately accepted. If you have invested energy in their preparation, no one will think poorly of you for it.
