# How to Tell People Things They Don't Want to Hear

Often, you'll find yourself in positions where you need to deliver news that might not be well-received. It's important to understand that there's a purpose behind sharing such information. Communicating issues promptly ensures that everyone is adequately informed, even if the situation cannot be immediately rectified.

The most effective approach when highlighting a problem is to **simultaneously propose a solution**. A close second is to seek assistance in addressing the issue. If there's a risk your message might be met with skepticism, securing evidence to **back up your claim is crucial**.

A particularly tough message you may need to convey is, ‘We need to delay the project schedule.’ No programmer enjoys making this announcement, yet it's critical to communicate such delays as soon as possible. Delaying the inevitable update only exacerbates the situation. Ideally, this type of news should be shared with a team mindset, drawing upon collective input regarding the current status and potential solutions. Ultimately, the team must confront and navigate the fallout together.
