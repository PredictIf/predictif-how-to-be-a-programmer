# How to Get a Promotion

To be promoted to a role, act out that role first.

To get promoted to a title, find out what is expected of that title and do that.

To get a pay raise, negotiate armed with information.

If you believe a promotion is overdue, initiate a conversation with your boss. Directly inquire about the actions required for advancement, and strive to meet these criteria. While this advice may seem straightforward, there's often a discrepancy between your view of the necessary steps and your boss's perspective. Engaging in this dialogue not only clarifies these steps but also subtly holds your boss accountable.

Many developers might overestimate their skills to some extentâ€”not everyone can be in the top 10%, after all. Yet, I've encountered individuals who were genuinely underrecognized. While it's unrealistic to expect flawless assessment from everyone, people tend to be reasonably fair, provided one condition: **your contributions must be visible.** Lack of visibility, whether due to remote work, physical distance from the team and management, or simply not sharing achievements, can significantly hinder recognition. Especially the remote work. If you're working remotely, you need to be more proactive about sharing your achievements.
