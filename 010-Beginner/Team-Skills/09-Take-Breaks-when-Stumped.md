# Take Breaks when Stumped

When stumped, take a break. I sometimes meditate for 15 minutes when stumped and the problem magically unravels when I come back to it. A match of pingpong can also be magical. A night's sleep sometimes does the same thing on a larger scale. Temporarily switching to other activity may work.
