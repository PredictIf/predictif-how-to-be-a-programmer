# How to Estimate Programming Time

Mastering estimation requires practice and effort, so much so that you might even need to estimate the time it takes to create an estimate, especially for large-scale tasks.

When faced with a request for a large estimate, the wisest approach is to buy time. Engineers, often eager to please, may find this approach disappointing to those waiting. However, giving an immediate estimate can lead to inaccuracies.

During this bought time, consider exploring or prototyping the task at hand if circumstances allow. This can be the most reliable method for estimating and also contributes to actual progress.

If immediate exploration isn't feasible, ensure you clearly understand what the estimate entails. Begin and conclude your estimate by clarifying its scope. Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, aiming for each to take no more than a day. It's crucial not to overlook any aspect of the project, including documentation, testing, planning, communication, vacation time, and even dealing with interruptions. Documenting these factors provides transparency about time allocation and could lead to extended timelines.

While some engineers prefer to cushion their estimates to account for unpredictability, it's advisable to avoid this practice as it can erode trust. Instead, if you anticipate a task could extend significantly beyond the expected timeframe due to potential obstacles, make a note of this in your estimate or adjust the estimate based on a weighted average of possible outcomes. Incorporate any identifiable risk factors into your planning. Acknowledge the certainty of unforeseen challenges, known as "unk-unks," and consider including a contingency for these in your estimate. Communication about these uncertainties is vital to ensure they are factored into planning.

In a team setting, involve those who will be doing the work in the estimation process to reach a collective agreement. This accounts for individual differences in skills and experience and helps in reallocating tasks more effectively, thereby strengthening the team's overall performance.

It's also essential to openly discuss significant risks that are difficult to assess with your manager. Highlighting these risks ensures that commitments are not made lightly, potentially preventing future complications. Achieving a consensus on the estimate within the team not only sharpens the team's understanding but also facilitates strategic resource allocation, safeguarding against the allocation of challenging estimates to less experienced team members.
