# Learning Path for Blockchain Programming and Understanding Blockchain Databases


Here's a curated guide to get you started on blockchain programming and understanding blockchain databases:

1. **Understand the Basics of Blockchain**:
   - **"Mastering Blockchain" by Imran Bashir** is a comprehensive book, available on Amazon and other book retailers. It doesn't have a free online version, but it's worth checking your local library for access.
   - For a free introduction, **Blockchain A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain** on Udemy offers a solid foundation: [Blockchain A-Z on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-blockchain-az/).

2. **Learn Solidity for Ethereum Development**:
   - **CryptoZombies** is a fun, interactive way to learn Solidity by building your own crypto-collectibles game: [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/).

3. **Familiarize Yourself with Blockchain Development Tools**:
   - **Truffle Suite** offers a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it easier to develop smart contracts: [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).
   - **Hardhat** is another Ethereum development environment designed for advanced developers, found here: [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

4. **Understand Blockchain Databases and Storage Solutions**:
   - To get a grasp on decentralized storage, **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) has a comprehensive documentation that explains how it works: [IPFS Documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/).

5. **Dabble in a Blockchain Project**:
   - Starting your own project is crucial. Ethereum's official website offers a great starting point with tutorials and project ideas: [Ethereum.org Developer Tutorials](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/).

6. **Join a Community**:
   - The Ethereum community on Reddit is a great place to start, offering a mix of advice, discussions, and project ideas: [r/ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/).
   - For blockchain technology in general, [r/Blockchain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockchain/) is also worth checking out.

7. **Keep Up-to-Date**:
   - **CoinDesk** and **The Block** are good sources for blockchain news and updates: [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/) and [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/).

Engaging with these resources will provide you with a robust start in blockchain programming and understanding blockchain databases. Remember, the field is rapidly evolving, so staying curious and continuously learning is key.
